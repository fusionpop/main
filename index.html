                As an AI/ML Lead and technical innovator, I spearheaded the 
                development of a Vision Language Model to enable first-step 
                diagnosis for arrhythmia using ECG/EGM data. My work led to 
                the filing of four patents, advancing deep learning-based 
                mapping techniques that have become foundational in this domain. 
                In my role as Tech Lead and SCRUM Master on a 3D mapping model 
                enhancement project with $200M in funding, I successfully led 
                efforts to improve high-precision mapping for better outcomes. 
                Additionally, I designed and patented a catheter navigation system, 
                which drove a significant 14% revenue increase, contributing 
                to a total of $2.2B in revenue. I also developed a high-performance 
                data pooling platform capable of real-time data transmission at 
                speeds of up to 2000 Hz, and built a robust data warehousing 
                platform for efficient, real-time data storage.</p>

                As a technical lead in energy market demand planning, I developed 
                deep learning models that significantly reduced operational costs, 
                achieving savings of over $1 million. I also built a large-scale, 
                agent-based vehicle routing simulator for energy forecasting, 
                a project that secured $3.3 million in funding over five years. 
                Additionally, I designed a scalable data warehousing solution on 
                AWS Cloud, enabling robust simulations and efficient data storage 
                to support long-term growth and adaptability in forecasting capabilities.</p>

                I developed a data-driven optimization framework for connected and 
                automated vehicles, a project that secured $2.8 million in funding 
                from the U.S. Department of Energy and an additional $500,000 from 
                the National Science Foundation. Additionally, I integrated risk 
                management into vehicle fleet scheduling, with findings presented 
                directly to U.S. Senator Gary Peters. In a role at the ITS lab, 
                I deployed Hadoop for high-volume traffic data storage, managing over 
                64 terabytes of traffic monitoring data. Leveraging deep learning, 
                I created a model to identify moving vehicles from drone footage, 
                resulting in a traffic detection tool presented to the Michigan 
                Department of Transportation (MDOT). My work also involved collaborating 
                with General Motors to implement a cloud-based communication and 
                computation system. Furthermore, I designed an optimization model for 
                the placement of traffic monitoring sensors, effectively reducing traffic 
                operation costs across various initiatives.</p>
